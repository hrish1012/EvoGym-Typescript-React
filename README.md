# EvoGym-Typescript-React
Evogym is a Fitness Application for Gyms developed using ReactJS and Typescript majorly.

For the frontend development, we have used React, Typescript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Hero Icons, Framer Motion, Form Submit, and React Anchor Link Smooth Scroll.

It is developed as my first implementation of typescript following a youtube reference.
